#   Autocat Initial Load
# To be used upon initial database
# install or database rebuild.
###############################

In order to set the autocat state based off of a previously saved autocat dump,
you'll need to perform the following steps:

1. Place autocat.sql.backup file into /tmp. By default, these backups are distributed
into /etc/nsm/backup on all sensors.

2. Either run chef-client as root or wait for the next scheduled chef-client run.

* Chef-client will run the mysql command to recreate the autocat table and
* populate the rules, restarting nsm as needed.
